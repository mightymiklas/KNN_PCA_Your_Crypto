# Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis

This analysis involves data cleaning, PCA (principal component analysis), and clustering analysis using K-Means to identify trends or clusters of data. 


---

## Technologies

Python 3.7 and above and has been constructed in the jupyter lab notebook named ```crypto_investments.ipynb```
The following libraries are required:

- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - for analyzing data
- [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) - for building ML models
- [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/) - for an IDE
- [hvplot](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - for creating interactive Visualizations of data
- [pyviz](https://pypi.org/project/pyviz/) - for visualizing data
- [holoviews](https://pypi.org/project/holoviews/) - for creating interactive plots

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install jupyterlab
